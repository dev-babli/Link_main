**Visual Interference**

- ❌ Gray button looks disabled but isn't
- ✅ Clear, distinguishable states

**Nagging**

- ❌ Constant review request pop-ups
- ✅ Ask once, remember answer

**Fake Social Proof**

- ❌ "John just booked!" (fake)
- ✅ Real data or no social proof

### 🤝 Choice Manipulation

**Confirmshaming**

- ❌ "No thanks, I hate saving money"
- ✅ Neutral: "Continue without subscription"

**Trapped Choices**

- ❌ Only "Pay" or "Watch Ads" options
- ✅ Always provide clear "No thanks"

**Overchoice**

- ❌ 40+ vague privacy toggles
- ✅ Reasonable, organized options

**Preselection**

- ❌ Pre-checked "Subscribe to marketing"
- ✅ User must actively opt-in

### 🚧 Obstruction

**Roach Motel**

- ✅ Unsubscribe as easy as subscribe

**Hidden Features**

### 💰 Pricing Manipulation

**Hidden Costs**

- ❌ Fees revealed at checkout
- ✅ Show all costs upfront

**Drip Pricing**

- ❌ $99 base + $50 fee + $30 tax = $254 surprise
- ✅ Show realistic total early

**Bait and Switch**

- ❌ "X" closes ad → installs software
- ✅ Buttons do what they say

**Fake Scarcity**

- ❌ "Only 1 left!" (resets after refresh)

### 🔒 Privacy Exploits

**Disguised Ads**

- ❌ Fake "Download" button that's an ad
- ✅ Clearly label all ads

**Privacy Zuckering**

- ❌ Default privacy: "Public"
- ✅ Default to most private

**Friend Spam**

- ❌ Access contacts → emails everyone
- ✅ Clear explanation, easy opt-out

**Obfuscated Consent**

- ❌ "Accept all": 1 click, "Reject": 4 clicks
- ✅ Equal effort for both
