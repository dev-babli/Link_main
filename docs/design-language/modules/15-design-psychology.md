## üß† Cognitive Psychology for Designers

### How the Brain Processes Design

**Two Systems of Thinking:**

**System 1 (Fast, Automatic):**

- Instant reactions
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional responses
- Requires no effort

**System 2 (Slow, Deliberate):**

- Logical analysis
- Conscious decisions
- Requires mental effort
- Tires quickly

**Design Implication:**
Design for System 1. Make things instant and obvious.

## üëÅÔ∏è Attention and Perception

### Visual Attention

**Pre-attentive Processing:**
Noticed instantly (< 500ms):

- Color
- Size
- Motion
- Orientation

**Use for:**

- Highlighting important elements
- Creating visual hierarchy
- Guiding eye movement

### Selective Attention

**People can focus on only one thing at a time.**

**Avoid:**

- Multiple competing CTAs
- Too many visual elements
- Animation overkill

**Design for:**

- Clear focal points
- One primary action per screen
- Minimal distractions

### Attention Span

**Average:** 8 seconds

**Design Response:**

- Front-load important information
- Show value quickly
- Progressive disclosure for details

---

## üß© Memory and Recall

### Types of Memory

**Sensory Memory:**

- Duration: < 1 second
- Visual impressions
- **Design use:** Smooth animations

**Short-term Memory:**

- Duration: 20-30 seconds
- Capacity: 7¬±2 items (Miller's Law)
- **Design use:** Limit navigation items, form fields

**Long-term Memory:**

- Duration: Years
- Pattern-based recall
- **Design use:** Consistent patterns, branding

### Recognition vs. Recall

**Recognition is easier than recall.**

**Good:**

- ‚úÖ Show recent files
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete suggestions
- ‚úÖ Icon + label
- ‚úÖ Visual thumbnails

**Bad:**

- ‚ùå Remember file names
- ‚ùå Type from memory
- ‚ùå Icon only (unknown)
- ‚ùå Text-only lists

## üéØ Decision-Making Frameworks

### Hick's Law

**More choices = Longer decision time**

**Formula:** T = b √ó log‚ÇÇ(n + 1)

**Application:**

- Limit options to 5-7
- Progressive disclosure
- Categorize choices
- Use smart defaults

### Paradox of Choice

**Too many options = Decision paralysis**

**Examples:**

- Netflix: Curated categories
- Spotify: Personalized playlists
- Apple: 3-4 product tiers max

**Solution:**

- Recommend best option
- "Popular choice" indicators
- Limited, curated options

### Decision Fatigue

**Every decision drains mental energy.**

**Design Response:**

- Smart defaults
- Save preferences
- Reduce unnecessary choices
- Make easy things easy

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Design

### Three Levels (Don Norman)

**1. Visceral Level (Appearance)**

- First impression
- Aesthetic appeal
- Immediate emotional response

**2. Behavioral Level (Usability)**

- How it works
- Functionality
- User experience

**3. Reflective Level (Meaning)**

- Personal connection
- Brand association
- Long-term satisfaction

### Emotional States and Design

**Anxious users:**

- Need reassurance
- Clear feedback
- Progress indicators
- "You can undo this"

**Confused users:**

- Need guidance
- Tooltips and help
- Clear labels
- Examples

**Frustrated users:**

- Need empathy
- Helpful error messages
- Quick solutions
- Support access

**Delighted users:**

- Surprise moments
- Smooth interactions
- Personality

## üéÅ Behavioral Economics for UX

### Loss Aversion

**People fear loss more than they value gain.**

**Ratio:** Losses feel 2√ó more powerful than gains

**Application:**

- "Don't miss out" > "Get this"
- Free trial with features > "Try basic version"
- "Save 20%" > "Pay 80%"
- Cancel subscription: "You'll lose access to..."

### Anchoring Effect

**First number seen influences perception.**

**Example:**

```
Was: $199
Now: $99 (50% off!)
```

**Use in:**

- Pricing pages
- Discount displays
- Comparison tables

### Social Proof

**People follow others' actions.**

**Types:**

- "1,000+ customers"
- "Trusted by Google, Apple, Amazon"
- Star ratings and reviews
- "Most popular" badges
- User testimonials

**Effectiveness:**
Increases conversions by 15-30% on average.

### Scarcity Principle

**Limited availability increases value.**

**Ethical use:**

- "Only 3 left in stock" (if true)
- "Sale ends in 24 hours" (if true)
- Limited edition products

**Unethical use:**

- Fake scarcity
- Manipulative countdown timers
- False urgency

**See:** [Module 01: Design Ethics](01-design-ethics.md)

### Reciprocity

**People feel obligated to give back.**

**Application:**

- Free value first (content, tools)
- Free trial with full features
- Helpful support before purchase
- Educational resources

### Commitment and Consistency

**People want to act consistently with commitments.**

**Application:**

- Progressive profiling (small asks first)
- Multi-step forms (commitment builds)
- Progress bars (don't want to quit)
- Account creation (invested time)

### Framing Effect

**How information is presented affects decisions.**

**Examples:**

```
BAD: "10% failure rate"
GOOD: "90% success rate"

BAD: "Costs only $10/month"
GOOD: "Less than $0.33/day"

BAD: "Basic plan"
GOOD: "Starter plan"
```

## üí≠ Mental Models

### Definition

User's internal understanding of how something works.

### Examples

**File System:**

- Users think: Files in folders
- Reality: Database entries with paths
- Design: Show folders and files

**Email:**

- Users think: Letters in mailbox
- Reality: Database records
- Design: Inbox, folders, envelope icon

**Shopping Cart:**

- Users think: Physical cart
- Reality: Session storage
- Design: Cart icon, add/remove items

### Designing for Mental Models

**1. Research User Expectations**
What do users already know?

**2. Match Existing Patterns**
Don't reinvent common interactions.

**3. Use Familiar Metaphors**
Trash can, folders, shopping cart.

**4. Provide Clear Feedback**
Confirm actions match expectations.

**5. Test with Users**
Does your model match theirs?
