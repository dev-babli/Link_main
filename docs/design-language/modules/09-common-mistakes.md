## ⚠️ The 20 Most Common Mistakes

### Visual Element Mistakes

#### 1. Bad Color Contrast

**Problem:** Light gray text on white background.
**Fix:** Use contrast checker. Aim for 4.5:1 minimum (AA).
**Tool:** WebAIM Contrast Checker

#### 2. Too Many Fonts

**Problem:** Mixing 4+ typefaces = chaos.
**Fix:** 2 fonts maximum (1 for headings, 1 for body).

#### 3. Inconsistent Spacing

**Problem:** Random margins and padding.
**Fix:** Use spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px).

#### 4. No Visual Hierarchy

**Problem:** Everything same size/weight.
**Fix:** Clear size differences. Headlines > subheads > body > captions.

#### 5. No Visible Labels

**Problem:** Placeholder text as only label.
**Fix:** Always use visible, persistent labels outside input fields.

### UX Mistakes

#### 6. Ignoring Mobile Users

**Problem:** Desktop-only optimization.
**Fix:** Mobile-first design. Test on actual devices.

#### 7. Auto-playing Audio/Video

**Problem:** Uninvited noise startles users.
**Fix:** User must initiate playback. Default to muted.

#### 8. Scroll Hijacking

**Problem:** Taking over user's scroll breaks expectations.
**Fix:** Let users scroll naturally. Smooth effects OK, but don't force.

#### 9. Pop-ups Right Away

**Problem:** Interrupting before user settles in.
**Fix:** Wait 30+ seconds or until scroll/interaction.

#### 10. Form Overload

**Problem:** Asking for too much information.
**Fix:** Only ask what you truly need. Multi-step if necessary.

#### 11. Forgetting Empty States

**Problem:** Blank dashboards feel broken.
**Fix:** Design for "no content yet" with helpful message and CTA.

#### 12. Loading States Missing

**Problem:** Click with no feedback = confusion.
**Fix:** Always show loading indicator, even for fast actions.

#### 13. Modals That Trap You

**Problem:** No clear way to close modal.
**Fix:** X button + click outside + ESC key all close modal.

### UI Mistakes

#### 14. Tiny Touch Targets

**Problem:** Buttons too small to tap reliably.
**Fix:** 44×44px minimum (48×48px preferred).

#### 15. Overcomplicated Navigation

**Problem:** Nested menus 5 levels deep.
**Fix:** 3-click rule. Clear, simple labels. Logical grouping.

#### 16. Confusing Button Labels

**Problem:** "Yes" and "No" without context.
**Fix:** Specific labels: "Delete Account" not "Yes".

#### 17. No Feedback After Actions

**Problem:** Did it work? Who knows.
**Fix:** Success message, loading state, or confirmation.

#### 18. Misusing Icons

**Problem:** Abstract icons without labels.
**Fix:** Pair icons with text for clarity. Test with users.

### Branding & Trust Mistakes

#### 19. Skipping Accessibility

**Problem:** Screen readers can't navigate.
**Fix:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, alt text.

#### 20. Animations That Drag

**Problem:** 2-second fade makes site feel slow.
**Fix:** Keep animations under 300ms. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
