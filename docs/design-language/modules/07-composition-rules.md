## ðŸ“‹ The 15 Composition Rules

From the training material provided, these are the fundamental rules for creating well-composed designs.

### 1. Keep Your Colors on Point

**Choose wisely:**

- High contrast: striking
- Low contrast: natural
- Use color wheel for schemes
- Complementary: opposites
- Analogous: neighbors
- Monochrome: single hue

**Application:** Pick 2-4 colors max for any design.

---

### 2. Guide the Viewer with Leading Lines

**Use lines to direct attention:**

- Actual lines (arrows, paths)
- Implied lines (edges, alignment)
- Motion (parallax, animation)

**Application:** Create visual paths through your layout.

---

### 3. Add Movement

**Create flow:**

- Curves and lines
- Rhythm of repeated shapes
- Smart spacing
- Animation

**Application:** Design shouldn't feel staticâ€”create visual journey.

---

### 4. Use Negative Space

**White space is design:**

- Gives elements room to breathe
- Creates focus
- Prevents overwhelming
- Implies luxury/quality

**Application:** Don't fill every pixel. Empty space is powerful.

---

### 5. Play with Contrast

**Make things pop:**

- Light vs dark
- Large vs small
- Thick vs thin
- Color vs grayscale

**Application:** High contrast = attention. Low contrast = subtlety.

---

### 6. Stick to the Grid

**Grid creates order:**

- Align elements
- Create rhythm
- Build consistency
- Allow breaking for emphasis

**Application:** Use grid, but know when to break it intentionally.

---

### 7. Divide it into Thirds

**Rule of thirds:**

- Imagine 3Ã—3 grid
- Place important elements at intersections
- Creates balanced, interesting compositions

**Application:** Position key elements at grid intersections.

---

### 8. Balance the Edge Game

**Consider edges:**

- Too close to border: cramped
- Right spacing: breathable
- Elements can touch edges intentionally

**Application:** Mind your margins and how elements relate to boundaries.

---

### 9. Repeat Your Elements

**Consistency through repetition:**

- Same fonts throughout
- Consistent colors
- Repeated patterns
- Uniform spacing

**Application:** Repetition creates unity and professionalism.

---

### 10. Less is More

**Simplicity wins:**

- Remove unnecessary elements
- Each element should serve purpose
- Clutter competes for attention

**Application:** When in doubt, remove it.

---

### 11. Use Shapes That Work (Triangles!)

**Shapes guide and organize:**

- Circles: soft, group
- Squares: stable, structure
- Triangles: direct, dynamic

**Application:** Triangles naturally guide the eyeâ€”use them.

---

### 12. Smooth Out the Transitions

**Create connections:**

- Gradual color changes
- Curved lines between sections
- Smooth animations

**Application:** Don't jump between elementsâ€”flow between them.

---

### 13. Create Focus

**One main element first:**

- Size, bold color, or contrast
- Everything else supports it

**Application:** Hierarchyâ€”what should users see first?

---

### 14. Prioritize

**Visual ladder:**

- Headline high
- Subheading follows
- Body text after
- Details last

**Application:** Set clear order of importance through visual weight.

---

### 15. Keep Your Elements Balanced

**Visual weight distribution:**

- Symmetrical: calm, formal
- Asymmetrical: dynamic, interesting
- Large element needs small ones to balance

**Application:** Feel the weightâ€”does one side feel "heavier"?

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Practical Examples

**Good Composition:**

- Clear hierarchy
- Balanced elements
- Good use of space
- Intentional color
- Guides eye naturally

**Bad Composition:**

- Everything same size
- Cluttered, no space
- Random colors
- No clear path
- Unbalanced weight

---
