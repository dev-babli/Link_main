    <div class="right">This is placeholder text meant to help get a sense of spacing, rhythm, and overall layout. It’s not about meaning right now, just about flow. The focus is on structure, not story. As elements fall into place, you’ll start to notice how small adjustments make a big difference. Maybe the alignment needs a nudge, or the spacing feels tight in one section and too loose in another. That’s part of the process. Things shift around until they feel right. You can swap this out later once the content is ready, but for now, it helps to see how the design holds up with real-ish copy. No need to overthink it. Just keep moving, test different things, and see what works in context.</div>
