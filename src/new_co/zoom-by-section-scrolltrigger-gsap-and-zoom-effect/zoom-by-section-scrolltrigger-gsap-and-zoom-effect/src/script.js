/* 
This GSAP effect lets you zoom in on a particular spot of the target - you define the scale and the origin as an Array of x/y normalized values. Like {scale: 3, origin: [0.25, 0.8]} would zoom in on the spot that's 25% from the left, and 80% from the top of the element/image. It will return an animation that controls the xPercent, yPercent, and scale (as well as any other values you pass in, like a normal tween). It won't let the edges collapse toward the center. It's best to put the element into a container that has overflow: hidden.

Example: 

gsap.effects.zoom(".photo", {
  scale: 3,
  origin: [0.25, 0.8],
  duration: 1,
  ease: "power1.inOut"
});
