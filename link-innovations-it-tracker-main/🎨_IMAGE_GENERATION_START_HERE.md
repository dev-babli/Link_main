## ✅ Before You Generate Checklist

**Every time, check these 5 things:**

1. [ ] **Colors** - Did I include brand hex codes?
2. [ ] **Aspect Ratio** - Is `--ar X:X` correct for my use?
3. [ ] **Quality** - Did I add `--q 2 --v 6.1`?
4. [ ] **Style** - Did I specify "modern tech aesthetic"?
5. [ ] **Purpose** - Is this appropriate for the page/component?

---

## 🎯 Prompt Formula (Universal)

```
[SUBJECT] + [SETTING] + [BRAND COLORS] + [LIGHTING] + [MOOD] + [TECHNICAL]

Example:
AI neural network + futuristic lab +
blue (#3B82F6) and purple (#8B5CF6) +
dramatic lighting + innovative mood +
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.1 --q 2
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Generate Multiple Variations

```
Use --repeat 4 to get 4 versions at once
Example: [your prompt] --repeat 4
```

### 2. Test Quality First

```
Start with --q 1 for testing (faster, cheaper)
Use --q 2 for final production images
```

### 3. Batch Similar Images

```
Generate all hero images in one session
Generate all blog cards together
Keep style consistent within batches
```

### 4. Save Your Winners

```
Keep a "prompts that worked" document
Note which variations tested best
Reuse successful prompt patterns
```

### 5. Consider Text Overlay

```
Add to prompt: "space for text overlay on left/right"
Ensure darker/lighter areas for text placement
Test contrast before finalizing
```
