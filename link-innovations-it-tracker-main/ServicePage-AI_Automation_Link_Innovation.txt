Intro / Elevator Pitch
Short paragraph (60–80 words):
AI & Automation turns data into action. Link Innovation combines generative models, autonomous agents, and RPA to automate repetitive tasks, accelerate decision-making, and deliver measurable ROI. Whether you need intelligent document processing, autonomous workflow agents, or predictive maintenance models, our team designs production-ready AI systems with robust MLOps and enterprise-grade security.

Problems We Solve (H2)
- Manual processes slow down operations and increase error rates.
- Teams struggle to surface timely insights from growing data.
- LLMs and agents are hard to integrate and monitor in production.
- Model drift and performance gaps create business risk.

Our Capabilities (H2)
Intro: We package capabilities into fast, measurable outcomes — from discovery to production.

Sub-service cards
1. Agentic AI Solutions
   Autonomous agents that plan, reason, and execute workflows.
   - Use cases: Customer support agents, automated data analysts, procurement bots.
   - Outcomes: reduce manual handoffs, automated end-to-end workflows.

2. Generative AI (GenAI)
   Domain-tuned LLMs for content, summarization, code generation, and copilots.
   - Use cases: contract summarization, intelligent chat assistants, automated content drafts.
   - Outcomes: faster content creation, improved CSAT.

3. Process Automation (RPA + AI)
   Smart bots + orchestration for rule-based and cognition-enhanced tasks.
   - Use cases: invoice processing, claims handling, HR onboarding flows.
   - Outcomes: lower processing time & error rates.

4. Predictive Analytics & ML Models
   Forecasting, anomaly detection, prescriptive insights.
   - Use cases: demand forecasting, predictive maintenance, fraud scoring.
   - Outcomes: reduced downtime, improved forecast accuracy.

5. AI Integration & MLOps
   API-first deployments, monitoring, versioning & CI for models.
   - Use cases: model governance, retraining pipelines, data drift alerts.
   - Outcomes: stable model performance in production.

6. Computer Vision (optional add-on)
   Inspection, OCR, and visual recognition for manufacturing, retail, and healthcare.

How We Deliver (H2)
4-step delivery model:
1. Discover — Data assessment, business KPI mapping, PoC scope.
2. Design — Solution architecture, LLM prompt engineering, agent design.
3. Build — Model training, pipeline, RPA bots, integration with systems.
4. Operate — MLOps, monitoring, periodic retraining, business dashboards.
Typical timeline: PoC (3–6 weeks) → MVP (6–10 weeks) → Production (ongoing ops).

Outcomes & KPIs (H2)
- Time saved on manual tasks: up to 60% (typical)
- Forecast accuracy improvement: 10–30%
- Request automation: 50–80% automation rate
- Faster detection of model drift with monitoring

- Internal APIs and third-party SaaS

Case Study (H2)
Title: Autonomous Claims Processing for InsureCo
Problem: Manual claim intake averaged 36 hours per claim and high error rates.
Solution: Link Innovation built an agentic workflow combining GenAI summarization, OCR, and RPA, integrated with the insurer’s claims system and dashboards.
Outcome: Claim intake time reduced from 36 hours → 6 hours (83% faster). Error rate reduced 45%. ROI realized in 5 months.

Pricing Models & Engagement Options (H2)
- Discovery / Readiness Review — fixed fee (1–2 weeks) — deliverable: AI readiness report & PoC plan.
- PoC / MVP — T&M or fixed-scope (4–8 weeks) — working prototype.
- Productization & Ops — monthly retainer / managed service (SLA-based).
- License / Component — for reusable platforms (white-labelled agents).

Testimonials / Trust (H2)
- “Link Innovation’s AI agents reduced our manual processing time by over 70% and helped us scale.” — Head of Ops, InsureCo

FAQ (H2)
Q: How do you protect sensitive data in LLMs?
A: We use data isolation, encryption, private hosted models, redaction, and strict access policies.

Q: What data is required for a PoC?
A: Representative sample documents/data (1–4 weeks), business rules, and target KPIs.

Q: How long until ROI?
A: Many clients see measurable impact within 3–6 months after deployment (PoC → MVP → ops).
