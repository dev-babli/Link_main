# Animation Fix - Content Visibility Restored

## 🚨 Issue Found

All content was hidden due to incorrect viewport detection settings in scroll animations.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Viewport Detection Fixed**

**Problem:** Used `margin: "-100px"` which meant animations only triggered AFTER scrolling 100px past the element.

**Solution:** Changed to `amount: 0.2` which triggers when 20% of element is visible.

```tsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true, margin: "-100px" });

// AFTER (FIXED)
const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true, amount: 0.2 });
```

### 2. **Above-the-Fold Content**

**Problem:** Hero section, navbar, and banner were hidden behind animations.

**Solution:** Removed animations from these critical elements so they display immediately:

- ✅ Announcement Banner → No animation (instant)
- ✅ Navigation → No animation (instant)
- ✅ Hero Section → No animation (instant)

### 3. **Animation Trigger Settings**

- **amount: 0.2** → Triggers when 20% visible (more reliable)
- **once: true** → Animations only play once (performance)
- All other sections still have smooth scroll animations

## ✅ Result

- ✅ Content is now visible immediately on page load
- ✅ Navbar and hero section display instantly
- ✅ Scroll animations still work for lower sections
- ✅ Much better user experience

## 📍 Files Modified

1. `src/components/MaskReveal.tsx` - Fixed viewport detection
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Removed animations from critical above-fold content

**Status:** FIXED ✅  
**Page is now fully functional with content visible**
