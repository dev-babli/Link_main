Intro / Elevator Pitch
Short paragraph (60–80 words):
Link Innovation provides full-stack test automation services to ensure faster, more reliable releases. From functional E2E tests to API and performance testing, our frameworks are built to integrate with your CI/CD pipelines and scale with your product lifecycle.

Problems We Solve (H2)
- Manual regression cycles delaying releases.
- Unreliable test coverage and flaky tests.
- Performance bottlenecks undetected until production.
- Mobile fragmentation and device coverage challenges.

Our Capabilities (H2)
Intro: Testing services and frameworks for modern development teams.

Sub-service cards
1. Functional Test Automation
   UI and functional workflows automated with Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium.
   - Use cases: regression suites, smoke tests.
   - Outcomes: faster release validation and fewer regressions.

2. API & Integration Testing
   Contract and integration testing with Postman, RestAssured, and contract tests.
   - Use cases: API stability, schema validation.
   - Outcomes: reliable backend integration and fewer runtime errors.

3. Mobile App Test Automation
   Appium, Detox and cloud device labs for multi-device coverage.
   - Use cases: behavioral, compatibility testing.
   - Outcomes: consistent mobile experiences across devices.

4. Performance & Load Testing
   k6, JMeter, Gatling to simulate traffic and identify bottlenecks.
   - Use cases: scale testing, capacity planning.
   - Outcomes: identify performance limits and optimize resources.

5. Continuous Testing (CI/CD Integration)
   Embed test suites in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps pipelines.
   - Use cases: pre-merge checks, nightly regression runs.
   - Outcomes: shift-left testing and faster feedback loops.

How We Deliver (H2)
Testing engagement model:
1. Audit — test coverage & flakiness analysis.
2. Framework build — implement automation frameworks and pipelines.
3. Integrate — CI/CD embedding and reporting dashboards.
4. Maintain — test upkeep and expansion as product evolves.
Timeline: Audit (1–2 weeks), Framework (2–6 weeks), Ongoing maintenance.

Outcomes & KPIs (H2)
- Regression cycle time reduced by up to 80%.
- Test coverage improvement and fewer production bugs.
- Performance baselining and fewer outages under load.

Architecture & Tech Stack (H2)
Recommended stack:
- Web: Cypress, Playwright, Selenium
- Mobile: Appium, Detox, BrowserStack
- API: Postman, Newman, RestAssured
- Performance: JMeter, k6, Gatling
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps
- Reporting: Allure, TestRail, custom dashboards

Integrations & Data Sources (H2)
- CI/CD pipelines, artifact stores, monitoring tools
- Device farms and cloud labs for mobile testing

Case Study (H2)
Title: Automated Regression for SaaS Platform Y
Problem: Long regression cycles delayed releases and caused rollbacks.
Solution: Implemented Cypress E2E suites, integrated into CI with parallel runs and flaky test handling.
Outcome: Regression time reduced from 48 hours to under 3 hours and rollback rate decreased significantly.

Pricing Models & Engagement Options (H2)
- Testing Audit — fixed fee
- Framework Build — fixed/t&M
- Continuous Testing Support — monthly retainer

Testimonials / Trust (H2)
- “Link Innovation’s automation cut our regression window and improved release confidence.” — QA Lead, SaaSY

FAQ (H2)
Q: How do you handle flaky tests?
A: We implement test isolation, retries with backoff, improved selectors, and parallelization strategies.
Q: Do you provide device labs?
A: Yes — we integrate with BrowserStack, Firebase Test Lab, and cloud device providers.
