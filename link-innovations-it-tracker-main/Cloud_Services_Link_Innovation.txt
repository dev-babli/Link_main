Intro / Elevator Pitch
Short paragraph (60–80 words):
Link Innovation helps enterprises migrate legacy systems, adopt infrastructure-as-code, and optimize cloud costs. We focus on automation, reliability, and security to maximize cloud ROI while minimizing risk. Our SRE-driven managed services keep critical systems available and performant.

Problems We Solve (H2)
- Risky lift-and-shift migrations and long rollback windows.
- High cloud spend due to poor resource sizing.
- Lack of observability and frequent outages.
- Slow, manual infrastructure provisioning.

Our Capabilities (H2)
Intro: End-to-end cloud services covering migration, automation, operations, and optimization.

Sub-service cards
1. Cloud Migration & Modernization
   Lift-and-shift or refactor strategies and execution.
   - Use cases: legacy apps, database migration, data replatforming.
   - Outcomes: faster deployment, modernization path.

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Automation
   Terraform, Pulumi, CDK, and automated environment provisioning.
   - Use cases: repeatable infra, blue/green deployments.
   - Outcomes: lower error rate, faster spin-up of environments.

3. Cloud Cost Optimization (FinOps)
   Rightsizing, reserved instances, autoscaling and billing automation.
   - Use cases: cost reduction programs, budget alerts.
   - Outcomes: 20–40% cost savings typically.

4. Managed Cloud Operations (SRE / DevOps)
   Monitoring, incident management, on-call, and runbooks.
   - Use cases: production support, release automation.
   - Outcomes: improved uptime and faster recovery.

5. Cloud Security & Compliance
   Secure configurations, encryption, and compliance checks.
   - Use cases: PCI/GDPR readiness, security baselines.
   - Outcomes: secure cloud posture and audit readiness.

How We Deliver (H2)
Cloud delivery lifecycle:
1. Assess — cloud readiness and TCO analysis.
2. Architect — migration plan and reference architectures.
3. Migrate & Modernize — execution and cutover planning.
4. Operate & Optimize — FinOps and SRE-led operations.
Timeline examples: Readiness review (1–2 weeks), Migration (4–12 weeks), Ongoing managed ops (monthly).

Outcomes & KPIs (H2)
- Deployment frequency: 3× improvement with CI/CD and IaC.
- Cost savings: 20–40% through FinOps measures.
- Uptime & reliability: 99.9%+ with SRE practices.
- Mean time to recovery improved substantially.

Architecture & Tech Stack (H2)
Recommended stack:
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
- IaC: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK
- Containers & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, CloudWatch

Case Study (H2)
Title: Migration & Cost Optimization for SaaSCo
Problem: SaaSCo faced high cloud spend and slow release cadence.
Solution: Performed migration to managed Kubernetes, refactored key services, implemented IaC and FinOps program.
Outcome: Reduced monthly cloud costs by 38% and improved deployment velocity by 4×.

Pricing Models & Engagement Options (H2)
- Cloud Readiness Review — fixed fee
- Migration Project — fixed/t&m (4–12 weeks)
- Managed Cloud Ops (SRE) — monthly retainer
- FinOps Program — consulting + ongoing automation

Testimonials / Trust (H2)
- “Link Innovation helped us cut cloud costs and scale reliably.” — VP Engineering, SaaSCo

FAQ (H2)
Q: Which cloud platform should we choose?
A: We recommend assessing business needs; we are multi-cloud and can recommend AWS/Azure/GCP based on workload.
