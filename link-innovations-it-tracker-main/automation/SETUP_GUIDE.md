## âœ… Verification

Check that you have:

1. **Images generated:**

   ```bash
   ls ../public/images/services
   # Should show: li-service-ai-automation-hero-v1.webp
   ```

2. **Report created:**

   ```bash
   ls ../automation-reports
   # Should show: generation-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md
   ```

3. **Proper file sizes:**
   - Hero images: < 500KB âœ“
   - Card images: < 200KB âœ“

---

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

The system is ready. Next time you need images:

```bash
npm run generate-images
```

That's it. The system handles everything else.

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module"

```bash
# Make sure you installed dependencies
npm install
```

### "GEMINI_API_KEY is not set"

Make sure `config.json` exists and has your API key (not the example placeholder).

### "Freepik API returned 401"

Your API key is invalid or expired. Check:

1. API key is copied correctly
2. No extra spaces in config.json
3. Your Freepik subscription is active

### "No images were generated"

Run analysis first:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

This shows what images are needed. If it says "0 images needed", all your pages already have imagery.

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### For Production Use:

1. **Generate all images:**

   ```bash
   npm run generate-images
   ```

2. **Review the report:**
   Open `automation-reports/generation-report-[date].md`

3. **Implement in components:**
   Copy code from report into your pages

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Text overlay contrast
   - Page load performance

5. **Deploy with confidence! âœ¨**

**Setup complete! Time to generate amazing images automatically. ðŸŽ¨**
