## 🎨 Prompts Used

### 1. Web app development - Hero

**Prompt:**
```
A dramatic, wide-angle over-shoulder view of a software architect's hands actively typing on a holographic keyboard, the keys shimmering with a subtle #8B5CF6 purple glow. The architect's arms and shoulders are visible, dressed in a sharp, modern professional outfit, with cinematic rim lighting from the top-left casting a bright highlight along their back. In the foreground, the edge of a polished, dark obsidian desk is visible, reflecting the ambient light. The focal point is sharply on the hands and the transparent holographic UI, which projects a complex web-app architecture diagram and code snippets in crisp #3B82F6 blue hues, with secondary interface elements and data streams accented in #06B6D4 cyan, creating a sense of dynamic information flow. The background features a sophisticated, modern tech lab environment with multiple floating, slightly out-of-focus vertical screens displaying various development dashboards, rendered with a beautiful bokeh effect (f/1.8 aperture, shallow DOF). Volumetric light rays, enhanced by a subtle atmospheric haze and glowing micro-particles, cut through the scene from unseen overhead light sources, adding depth and a premium feel. The right 30% of the image is intentionally composed to be less dense, providing clear empty space for text overlay, with the background elements softly receding. Ultra high resolution 8K, HDR, photorealistic, professional photography grade with subtle chromatic aberration on the light sources., 16:9 aspect ratio
