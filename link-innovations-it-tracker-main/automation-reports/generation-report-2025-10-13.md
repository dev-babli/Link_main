## 🎨 Prompts Used

### 1. Home - Hero

**Prompt:**
```
Close-up, over-shoulder perspective of a highly skilled engineer's hands confidently navigating a high-performance workstation within a sleek, futuristic command center. The primary focus is on the engineer's hands, resting on a matte black, ergonomic keyboard with subtle backlit keys glowing a vibrant `#3B82F6`. Immediately in front, a large, interactive curved display shows complex, multi-layered data visualizations and network architectures in brilliant shades of `#3B82F6` and `#06B6D4`, with critical alerts highlighted by a soft, ethereal `#E8FF7A` glow. To the sides, secondary ultra-wide monitors display cascading lines of code and real-time operational metrics. The back of the engineer's head and shoulders are subtly visible in the foreground, slightly out of sharp focus, creating a powerful sense of immersion and depth. Dramatic cinematic rim lighting, originating from a soft, ethereal source on the top-right, casts a distinct `#8B5CF6` glow on the engineer's silhouette and the sleek edges of the workstation. Volumetric fog permeates the background, catching numerous light rays that add to the innovative, high-tech atmosphere. HDR imaging enhances the profound contrast between the intensely illuminated UI elements and the deep, professional shadows. Adhering to the rule of thirds, the focal point—the dynamic interaction between hands and central screen—is positioned on the lower-right intersection. A very shallow depth of field (f/2.0 aperture) isolates the hands and central monitor with exquisite detail, while the background monitors are gently blurred with a creamy bokeh effect, allowing for an ample 30% text overlay space on the left side of the 16:9 frame. Subtle, sparkling dust particles float within the volumetric light, and delicate lens flares emanate from the screen's brightest points, contributing to the photorealistic 8K quality. A hint of chromatic aberration around extreme highlights adds photographic authenticity. Materials include anti-glare OLED screens, finely brushed aluminum bezels, soft-touch ergonomic keyboard materials, and highly reflective polished glass surfaces that subtly catch ambient light., 16:9 aspect ratio

Mid-range perspective, slightly elevated looking down at a dynamic, interconnected AI processing nexus – the heart of enterprise solutions. The central focal point is a magnificently crafted, multi-faceted core of glowing primary blue crystalline material (#3B82F6), intricately woven with fine metallic filaments. Surrounding this core are layers of meticulously designed circuit boards, crafted from brushed dark titanium and frosted glass, etched with complex data patterns illuminated by subtle primary cyan (#06B6D4) light paths. Floating above and around are abstract, geometric holographic data nodes, softly pulsing with primary purple (#8B5CF6) energy, strategically positioned along the rule of thirds. Dramatic cinematic rim lighting, originating from the upper left, casts a sharp #3B82F6 glow along the edges of every metallic and glass surface, emphasizing their cutting-edge form. Volumetric light rays, subtly tinted with a warm #8B5CF6 haze, pierce through a dense, metallic-sheen atmospheric fog that diffuses distant background elements. The composition features a shallow depth of field (f/2.8 aperture) ensuring the central nexus is in razor-sharp focus, while foreground elements and the background recede into a creamy, ethereal bokeh, with a hint of chromatic aberration on the brightest points. Microscopic data particles, illuminated by #06B6D4 highlights, gently drift through the volumetric fog. The entire left 30% of the 16:9 frame is intentionally clear, featuring only distant, blurred light trails and a faint, ethereal data mist, allowing for text overlay. Ultra high resolution 8K, photorealistic, professional photography grade., 16:9 aspect ratio

Wide-angle, over-shoulder perspective, slightly to the right, looking down at a person deeply engrossed in a multi-layered holographic interface and a sleek, unbranded laptop. The human element is represented by the forearms and hands (ethnic ambiguity, subtle skin texture) resting on a minimalist, glowing keyboard, and the back of a head with short, tidy hair. The main focal point is the keyboard and the dynamic, translucent holographic data stream emanating from the laptop, rendered in vivid #3B82F6 (Primary Blue) with crucial UI elements highlighted in #E8FF7A (Accent Yellow). The scene is set within a cutting-edge, modern tech laboratory or control room, dimly lit to emphasize the digital glow. Cinematic rim lighting, a powerful #8B5CF6 (Primary Purple) hue, dramatically outlines the person's shoulder and the laptop's metallic edge from the top-left, creating a high-contrast separation from the dark background. Volumetric fog, subtly tinted with the same #8B5CF6 glow, permeates the air, catching the light rays and adding immense depth. The composition adheres to the rule of thirds, with the laptop and hands positioned in the lower-left third, leaving the upper-right 30% of the 16:9 frame deliberately clear for text overlay. A shallow depth of field (f/2.0 aperture) ensures razor-sharp focus on the keyboard's keys and the immediate holographic projections, while the background elements – racks of server equipment with subtle #06B6D4 (Primary Cyan) indicator lights and blurred figures in the distance – melt into a soft, creamy bokeh. The laptop features a matte black finish with brushed metal accents; the holographic elements exhibit subtle chromatic aberration and a realistic lens flare originating from the core blue data streams, enhancing the photorealistic 8K quality., 16:9 aspect ratio

Close-up over-shoulder view of a professional, diverse individual (back of head, left shoulder and arm visible) intently observing a series of interconnected, ultra-thin transparent screens. The subject, in a crisp dark suit, occupies the left third of the frame, their gaze directed towards the intricate data visualizations, network diagrams, and real-time analytics displayed across the glowing screens. The environment is a cutting-edge, secure data operations room, with subtle glimpses of futuristic server racks and cable management in the blurred background. The main screen graphics are rendered in vibrant #3B82F6 (Primary Blue), with critical alerts and highlighted pathways in #06B6D4 (Primary Cyan). A subtle, almost ethereal volumetric glow emanating from the screens and sharply rim-lighting the subject's silhouette is in #8B5CF6 (Primary Purple). Dramatic, cinematic rim lighting from the top-right casts a sharp, ethereal #8B5CF6 glow around the subject's head and shoulder, contrasting with the softly illuminated screens. Volumetric fog in the background diffuses the light, creating visible light rays that cut through the scene. The composition adheres to the rule of thirds, positioning the primary screen's focal point at an intersection. A shallow depth of field (f/1.8 aperture) renders the foreground subject's shoulder with a subtle, creamy bokeh, ensuring the intricate details of the central screen are tack sharp. The right 30% of the frame is intentionally left clear of distracting elements, featuring a smooth, dark, slightly reflective wall, ideal for text overlay. Subtle, slow-moving dust particles catch the light rays, creating a sophisticated, active yet controlled atmosphere. Minimal, controlled anamorphic lens flare and subtle chromatic aberration on screen edges enhance realism. Screens are made of ultra-clear, anti-reflective glass with a faint iridescent sheen, resting on a matte black composite desk. 8K, ultra high resolution, professional photography grade, HDR., 16:9 aspect ratio
