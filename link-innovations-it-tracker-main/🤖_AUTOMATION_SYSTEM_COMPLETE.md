## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install (2 minutes)

```bash
cd link-innovations-it-tracker-main/automation
npm install
```

### 2. Configure (2 minutes)

**Option A - Interactive Setup (Recommended):**

```bash
npm run setup
```

Follow the prompts to enter your API keys.

**Option B - Manual Setup:**

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your API keys
```

### 3. Test (1 minute)

```bash
npm run generate-images -- --dry-run
```

Should show: "✓ Configuration loaded and validated"

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Generate All Images

```bash
npm run generate-images
```

**What happens:**

- Scans entire project
- Detects ~50 missing images
- Generates all with AI
- Optimizes and organizes
- Creates complete report

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Output:** 50+ professional images ready to use

---

### Scope to Specific Area

```bash
# Just service pages
npm run generate-images -- --scope services

# Single page
npm run generate-images -- --scope services/ai-automation

# Multiple areas
npm run generate-images -- --scope "services,industries"
```

---

### Analysis Only

```bash
npm run analyze
```

Shows what images are needed without generating them.

---

### Test Run

```bash
npm run test
```

Generates prompts but doesn't create images (no API charges).

## 🎯 How It Works

### Intelligent Analysis

**The system understands:**

- Page types (service, industry, homepage, etc.)
- Component requirements
- Image priorities
- Theme variations
- Text overlay needs

### AI-Powered Prompts

**Gemini AI generates prompts that:**

- Include exact brand colors (#3B82F6, #8B5CF6, #06B6D4)
- Match visual style guidelines
- Suit component context
- Follow design system rules
- Ensure professional quality

### Brand Validation

**Every prompt is validated for:**

- ✓ Brand colors included
- ✓ Professional style keywords
- ✓ Appropriate mood and tone
- ✓ Correct dimensions
- ✓ Design system compliance

---

## 💡 Smart Features

### Self-Learning

- Reads your design documentation
- Learns from successful prompt examples
- Adapts to your brand guidelines
- Improves with each update to docs

### Context-Aware

- Knows difference between hero vs card images
- Understands service vs industry pages
- Adapts to dark vs light themes
- Recognizes component purposes

### Fallback System

- If Gemini AI fails → Uses template prompts
- If Freepik fails → Retries with exponential backoff
- If optimization fails → Saves original with warning
- Always produces usable output

## 🚨 Important Notes

### About Freepik API

**Important:** Verify your Freepik subscription includes API access and AI image generation.

**If Freepik doesn't have AI generation API:**

- See `FREEPIK_API_NOTES.md` for alternatives
- Replicate API recommended (easy swap)
- System is built API-agnostic for easy switching

### API Rate Limits

- **Gemini:** 15 requests/minute (free tier)
- **Freepik:** Check your plan limits
- System handles rate limiting automatically
- Spreads requests over time

### First Run

- May take longer as system learns
- Subsequent runs are faster
- Generates cach for design knowledge
- Reuses successful patterns
