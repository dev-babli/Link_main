# Animation System Rollback

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** REVERTED

## What Happened

The advanced animation system implementation broke the homepage rendering. All content became invisible.

## Action Taken

✅ **IMMEDIATELY REVERTED** all homepage animations to working versions:

- Restored `MaskReveal` component imports
- Restored `FadeInScale` component imports
- All animation wrappers back to original working state

## Current State

**WEBSITE IS NOW WORKING** - All content visible and functional

## Created But Not Integrated (Available for Future Use)

The following animation components were successfully built and tested in isolation:

- ✅ `src/lib/animation-config.ts` - Configuration system
- ✅ `src/lib/animation-utils.ts` - Utility functions
- ✅ `src/components/animations/AdvancedScrollAnimations.tsx` - Main component
- ✅ `src/components/animations/PixelateReveal.tsx` - Pixelate effects
- ✅ `src/components/animations/ImageZoomFill.tsx` - Image zoom
- ✅ `src/components/animations/MaskRevealAdvanced.tsx` - Advanced masks
- ✅ `src/components/animations/StaggerGroup.tsx` - Stagger groups
- ✅ `src/components/animations/GSAPScrollShowcase.tsx` - GSAP components
- ✅ `src/components/animations/AnimeJSEffects.tsx` - Anime.js effects
- ✅ `src/app/animation-showcase/page.tsx` - Demo page
- ✅ `docs/ANIMATION_STUDY.md` - Research documentation
- ✅ `docs/SCROLL_ANIMATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide

**Build Status:** All files compile successfully ✅  
**Demo Page:** Available at `/animation-showcase` for testing

## Lesson Learned

**DO NOT** integrate new animation components directly into production homepage without:

1. Testing in isolated environment first
2. Gradual rollout (one section at a time)
3. Verification that content remains visible
4. User approval before major changes

## Next Steps (If Requested)

1. Test individual animation components in demo page
2. Gradually integrate ONE component at a time
3. Verify each change doesn't hide content
4. Get user approval before proceeding

**PRIORITY: WEBSITE IS WORKING AGAIN** ✅
