## üé® Color Accuracy Tips

### Ensuring Accurate Brand Colors

**In Midjourney Prompts:**

1. Always include exact hex codes: `purple (#8B5CF6)`
2. Describe color relationships: `purple-to-blue gradient`
3. Specify saturation level: `vibrant` or `subtle`
4. Mention where colors appear: `purple accent lighting`

**Post-Generation Adjustment:**

1. Use color adjustment tools to match exact brand colors
2. Increase/decrease saturation as needed
3. Adjust hue to match specifications
4. Save color profiles for consistency

**Color Verification:**

- Use eyedropper tool to sample generated colors
- Compare to brand guidelines
- Adjust in post-production if needed
- Create color reference sheet for future use

---

## üì± Responsive Image Guidelines

### Mobile Considerations

**Mobile-Specific Images:**

- Portrait orientation (9:16) for mobile heroes
- Larger central subject (less peripheral detail)
- Higher contrast for smaller screens
- Simpler compositions
- Text-free zones more generous

**Mobile Prompt Adjustments:**

```
Add to prompt: close-up, centered composition,
high contrast, simple background, vertical format
```

### Desktop Optimization

**Desktop-Specific:**

- Wider compositions (16:9, 21:9)
- More detailed elements
- Layered depth
- Peripheral interest points
- Space for UI elements

---

## üß™ A/B Testing Recommendations

### Test These Variables

**For Hero Images:**

1. Light vs Dark background
2. Person-focused vs Technology-focused
3. Close-up vs Wide shot
4. One main color vs Gradient
5. Busy vs Minimal composition

**For Service Images:**

1. Abstract vs Concrete representation
2. With people vs Without people
3. UI mockup vs Environmental shot
4. Colorful vs Monochrome with color accent
5. Photorealistic vs Illustrated

**For Industry Images:**

1. Traditional setting with tech vs Modern tech facility
2. Wide establishing shot vs Detail close-up
3. People in action vs Technology focus
4. Day setting vs Night with tech lighting

### Testing Methodology

1. **Generate 2-3 variations** of critical images
2. **Implement all variations** in staging environment
3. **Gather feedback** from team and test users
4. **Test with real content** and text overlays
5. **Measure impact** on engagement metrics
6. **Select winner** based on data and brand fit

## üé¨ Animation & Motion Considerations

### Static Images for Animation

**When generating images that will be animated:**

1. **Leave breathing room** around subjects
2. **Avoid extreme motion blur** (unless intended)
3. **Provide multiple layers** (generate variations with/without elements)
4. **Higher resolution** for zooming effects
5. **Neutral expressions** for people (easier to animate)

### Cinemagraph-Style Images

**For subtle motion effects:**

```
Generate with: still environment, one element in motion,
high detail in moving element, clean separation between
static and dynamic elements
```
