## 🚨 NEVER DO THESE (Dark Patterns)

### Attention Tricks

❌ **Misdirection:** Bright "Accept All" vs tiny "Reject"  
❌ **Visual Interference:** Gray button looks disabled  
❌ **Nagging:** Constant pop-ups for reviews  
❌ **Fake Social Proof:** "John just booked!" (fake)

### Choice Manipulation

❌ **Confirmshaming:** "No thanks, I hate saving money"  
❌ **Trapped Choices:** No clear "No" option  
❌ **Overchoice:** 40+ confusing privacy toggles  
❌ **Preselection:** Pre-checked "Subscribe to offers"

### Obstruction

❌ **Roach Motel:** Cancel requires phone call  
❌ **Hidden Features:** Account deletion buried deep  
❌ **Trick Questions:** Double negatives, confusing wording  
❌ **Forced Action:** "Download app to continue" (web works)

### Pricing Manipulation

❌ **Hidden Costs:** Fees at final checkout  
❌ **Drip Pricing:** Gradual cost reveals  
❌ **Bait and Switch:** "X" installs software  
❌ **Fake Scarcity:** Countdown timers that reset

### Privacy Exploits

❌ **Disguised Ads:** Fake download buttons  
❌ **Privacy Zuckering:** Default to "Public"  
❌ **Friend Spam:** Email entire contact list  
❌ **Obfuscated Consent:** Accept: 1 click, Reject: 4 clicks

**🔴 These destroy trust, risk legal action, and harm users.**

## 🎨 13 Gestalt Principles

**How humans perceive visual information:**

1. **Proximity:** Close together = related
2. **Similarity:** Looks alike = same group
3. **Common Region:** Inside container = related
4. **Connectedness:** Visually linked = related
5. **Common Fate:** Move together = related
6. **Continuity:** Follow smooth paths
7. **Closure:** Brain completes shapes
8. **Figure-Ground:** Separate foreground from background
9. **Symmetry & Order:** Balance feels stable
10. **Prägnanz (Simplicity):** Simple over complex
11. **Emergence:** Whole before parts
12. **Invariance:** Recognizable when transformed
13. **Multistability:** Multiple interpretations

**Application:** Use these to create intuitive visual relationships.

## 📊 Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of system status** — Show what's happening
2. **Match system and real world** — Use user's language
3. **User control and freedom** — Provide undo/redo
4. **Consistency and standards** — Follow conventions
5. **Error prevention** — Prevent problems before they occur
6. **Recognition over recall** — Show options, don't require memory
7. **Flexibility and efficiency** — Support novice and expert
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist** — Remove unnecessary elements
9. **Help with error recovery** — Clear, constructive error messages
10. **Help and documentation** — Contextual help when needed

**Application:** Evaluate every design against these.

---

## 🎨 15 Composition Rules

1. **Keep colors on point** — 2-4 colors max, intentional schemes
2. **Guide with leading lines** — Direct eye movement
3. **Add movement** — Create visual flow
4. **Use negative space** — Whitespace creates focus
5. **Play with contrast** — High contrast = attention
6. **Stick to the grid** — Structure with intentional breaks
7. **Divide into thirds** — Rule of thirds for balance
8. **Balance edge game** — Mind margins and boundaries
9. **Repeat elements** — Consistency creates unity
10. **Less is more** — Remove unnecessary elements
11. **Use shapes that work** — Triangles guide eyes
12. **Smooth transitions** — Flow between elements
13. **Create focus** — One main element first
14. **Prioritize** — Clear visual hierarchy
15. **Keep balanced** — Distribute visual weight

**Application:** Every layout should follow these consciously.

## 🔟 10-Step Web Design Process

1. **Figure out what site needs to do** — Research, goals, audience
2. **Lock down scope** — Deliverables, timeline, budget
3. **Write before design** — Content first, not Lorem Ipsum
4. **Get organized** — Features, sitemap, assets, tools
5. **Lay out structure** — Sketches, wireframes, user flows
6. **Visual design (UI)** — Apply brand, create components
7. **Development** — Build, collaborate with devs
8. **Site testing** — Cross-browser, device, accessibility, performance
9. **Launch** — Deploy, monitor, support
10. **After launch** — Monitor, gather feedback, iterate

**Application:** Follow this process for all web projects.

## 🧠 Design Psychology Key Concepts

### System 1 vs System 2 Thinking

- **System 1:** Fast, automatic, emotional → Design for this
- **System 2:** Slow, deliberate, logical → Avoid requiring this

### Key Principles

- **Hick's Law:** More choices = longer decisions (limit to 5-7)
- **Miller's Law:** Short-term memory holds 7±2 items
- **Recognition > Recall:** Show options, don't require memory
- **Loss Aversion:** Fear loss 2× more than value gains
- **Social Proof:** People follow others
- **Scarcity:** Limited = more valuable (use ethically!)

### Color Psychology

- **Red:** Energy, urgency, passion (CTAs, errors)
- **Blue:** Trust, calm, professional (most universally liked)
- **Green:** Growth, success, health (success states, eco)
- **Yellow:** Optimism, caution, energy (warnings, highlights)
- **Purple:** Luxury, creativity (premium products)
- **Orange:** Friendly, confident (CTAs, fun brands)

---

## ⚡ Performance Standards

### Core Web Vitals Targets

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** < 2.5s
- **FID/INP (Interactivity):** < 100ms / < 200ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** < 0.1

### Optimization Techniques

- Images: WebP format, < 200KB, lazy loading
- CSS: Critical CSS inlined, unused removed
- JavaScript: Code splitting, tree shaking, deferred loading
- Animations: Transform/opacity only, GPU-accelerated, < 300ms
- Caching: Proper Cache-Control headers

---

## 📋 Mandatory Workflow

### Before ANY Design Work

1. Read DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md
2. Complete pre-work checklist (30 min)
3. Review relevant modules
4. Check quick references

### 6 Quality Checkpoints

1. **Concept Review** — Validate against principles
2. **Wireframe Approval** — UX patterns verified
3. **Visual Design Review** — Brand consistency checked
4. **Prototype Testing** — Accessibility and usability tested
5. **Pre-Launch Audit** — Complete compliance check
6. **Post-Launch Analysis** — Monitor and improve

**Cannot skip checkpoints. Cannot proceed without approval.**

---

## 🎯 Decision-Making Framework

**When Making Design Decisions:**

### Ask These Questions

1. **Ethical:** Is this helping users or taking advantage?
2. **Accessible:** Can everyone use this?
3. **Usable:** Is this easy to understand and use?
4. **Performant:** Does this affect performance?
5. **Consistent:** Does this follow our system?
6. **Documented:** Can I explain this decision?

### Red Flags

🚩 "Make it hard to unsubscribe"  
🚩 "Hide the opt-out"  
🚩 "Collect all possible data"  
🚩 "They don't need to know that"  
🚩 "Just copy [competitor's dark pattern]"

**Action:** Stop. Educate. Propose alternatives. Escalate if needed.

### Green Lights

✅ "How can we make this clearer?"  
✅ "Let's test this with users"  
✅ "Is this accessible?"  
✅ "What's best for users?"  
✅ "Can we simplify this?"

**Action:** Proceed with confidence.

## 💡 Key Principles Summary

### Ethical Design (Module 01)

**Core Question:** Is this helping users or exploiting them?

**11 Principles:**

1. Usability (easy and enjoyable)
2. Accessibility (design for all)
3. Privacy (respect data)
4. Transparency (no hidden traps)
5. User involvement (listen to real people)
6. Focus (respect time and attention)
7. Sustainability (consider environment)
8. Do no harm (put people first)
9. Integrity (moral code)
10. Honesty (avoid conflicts)
11. Privacy & confidentiality (protect user data)

### Visual Perception (Module 02)

**Gestalt tells us HOW humans see.**

**Key Takeaway:** Related items should look related. Use proximity, similarity, common regions, and connections to create visual relationships that match logical relationships.

### Usability (Modules 02, 04)

**Nielsen's heuristics are the gold standard.**

**Key Takeaway:** Make status visible, speak user's language, give control, be consistent, prevent errors, show options, support all skill levels, keep minimal, help with errors, provide help.

### Composition (Module 07)

**15 rules create professional layouts.**

**Key Takeaway:** Use color intentionally, guide eyes with lines, create movement, use whitespace, play with contrast, follow (then break) grids, balance visual weight.
