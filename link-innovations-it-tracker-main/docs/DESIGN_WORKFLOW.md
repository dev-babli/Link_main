## üéØ Rule #1: The Golden Rule

### Before Starting ANY Design Work

**YOU MUST:**

1. ‚úÖ Read the [DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Complete the **Mandatory Pre-Work Checklist** (below)
3. ‚úÖ Review relevant modules from `/docs/design-language/modules/`
4. ‚úÖ Check quick references in `/docs/design-language/quick-reference/`

**NO EXCEPTIONS.**

If you skip these steps, you WILL:

- ‚ùå Create accessibility violations
- ‚ùå Implement dark patterns accidentally
- ‚ùå Miss brand guideline requirements
